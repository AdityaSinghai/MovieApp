# movieee_app

This app is useful for maintaining an offline movie watchlist for users.

## Getting Started

Some major features of this project are-
* Adding Movie Data.
* Editing Movie Data.
* Deleting Movie Data.
* Like button for selecting the favourite movies.
* Authentication system using Firebase Auth so that only authorised users can add movies.

The database used for storing the movie data is Hive, which is an offline noSQL database management system.
The state management used for this project is Provider v5.0.0 which helps in seperating the logical layer from the UI layer.
